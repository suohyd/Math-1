            Let <m>A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{K})</m>. Denote by <m>R_i</m> (for <m>1\leq i\leq m</m>) the <m>i</m>-th row of <m>A</m>. Following are elementary row operations.
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Interchanging <m>i</m>-th row with <m>j</m>-th row. This operation is usually denoted by <m>R_i\leftrightarrow R_j</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Multiplying  <m>i</m>-th row by a nonzero <m>\alpha\in\mathbb{K}</m>. This operation is usually denoted by <m>R_i\mapsto \alpha R_i</m>.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Adding a constant multiple of <m>j</m>-th row to <m>i</m>-th row. This operation is usually denoted by <m>R_i\mapsto R_i+\alpha R_j</m>.

    <title>Procedure to obtain a row reduced echelon form of a matrix</title>
		Recall that given a matrix <m>A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{K})</m>, by applying a sequence of elementary row operations, can be reduced to a <term>row reduced echelon form <m>E_A</m> of <m>A</m></term>. The matrix <m>E_A</m> has the following properties.
		<ol>
            <li>All zero rows occurs at the bottom of <m>E_A</m>.</li>
			<li>If a row of <m>E_A</m> is nonzero then the first nonzero entry is <m>1</m>, it is called <term>pivot</term>.</li>
			<li>In any two successive nonzero rows of <m>E_A</m>, the pivot in the lower row occurs to the right of the pivot in the higher row.</li>
			<li>Each column of <m>E_A</m> that contains the pivot has zero everywhere else.</li>
		</ol>
  </note>
  <p>The natural question arises: Does the sequence in which row operations are performed change the resulting row reduced echelon form of <m>A?</m> The answer is no!</p>
