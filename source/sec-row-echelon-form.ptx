    <title>Procedure to obtain a row reduced echelon form of a matrix</title>
		Recall that given a matrix <m>A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{K})</m>, by applying a sequence of elementary row operations, can be reduced to a <term>row reduced echelon form <m>E_A</m> of <m>A</m></term>. The matrix <m>E_A</m> has the following properties.
		<ol>
            <li>All zero rows occurs at the bottom of <m>E_A</m>.</li>
			<li>If a row of <m>E_A</m> is nonzero then the first nonzero entry is <m>1</m>, it is called <term>pivot</term>.</li>
			<li>In any two successive nonzero rows of <m>E_A</m>, the pivot in the lower row occurs to the right of the pivot in the higher row.</li>
			<li>Each column of <m>E_A</m> that contains the pivot has zero everywhere else.</li>
		</ol>
  </note>
  <p>The natural question arises: Does the sequence in which row operations are performed change the resulting row reduced echelon form of <m>A?</m> The answer is no!</p>
